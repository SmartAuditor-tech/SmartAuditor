Here is my question previously @Yanis | Spectra


[02/24/2024 05:36] guy_in0xnito
Why use two types of math library  ? Especially the RAY (1e27)


[02/24/2024 07:56] 14si2o_flint
@Yanis | Spectra Hello!

Two questions concerning PT testing: 

1. In the setup() of the tests there is a reference made to line 35 of (https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/evm/src/lib.rs ). The link isn't working anymore (I think they refactored the repo?) Do you have an updated link by chance or could you explain what is being done here?

2. There are 5 PT.t.sol files, where each has slightly different deployment variables but also different sets of tests. Could you elaborate on thoughts behind this setup?

2. When testing the PT there are different parameters that can vary (especially since we are now permissionless in terms of what ibt we integrate):)


[02/24/2024 10:00] la_yan
I think we’ve tried explaining it as simply as possible in our docs, if not please let us know! But indeed Interest Bearing Tokens are tokens that basically represent a deposit of liquidity + interest. There wasn’t much to be done with them except holding them in your wallet. Now, if it’s a 4626 (or if you make a 4626 adaptor for it🫢) you can integrate it in Spectra 🎉


[02/24/2024 10:01] guy_in0xnito
A user can deposit both principal or IBT. Right ?


[02/24/2024 10:01] la_yan
Oh and sorry to strictly answer to your question the ibtRate we derive from the IBT is simply the underlying value you can get for an ibt unit at time T:)

[02/24/2024 10:14] guy_in0xnito
The depost function in PT.sol isn't that for depositing principal token ? 
Quoting from the docs  "If depositing the underlying asset, use PrincipalToken's deposit()."
 So a person can deposit let's say USDC. As PT. 
And get its yeild as aUSDC 
Which is similar to aave ?

No, we allow you to split your IBTs in 2 by depositing your ibts in the PT so that it mints you PTs and YTs:) hope that clarifies it


[02/24/2024 10:16] sweetjimmy_
> Before expiry a user needs the same amount of PT and YT to be able to `withdraw()` or `redeem()`. (from [this](https://dev.spectra.finance/guides/tokenising-yield) page)

how can this point be true when users are given different amounts of PTs and YTs on depositing an IBT?

so on depositing 100 aUSDC I'll get 100 PT **AND** 100 YT?


[02/24/2024 10:20] la_yan
Take a look at the deposit function in the PT to get the exact amount you’d get (it actually depends on the ibt rate, the pt rate), but the important thing is that you get the same amount of PTs and of YTs (to answer your previous question)

ohh.. okay that image I sent here got me a little confused. So the amount of PT and YT I'll get will be the same *but* their value in USDC will be different I guess. 100 USDC worth of PT and 3 USDC worth of YT (in case the APR was 3%)

Yes that is correct, assuming of course a « normal » naming/symbolling


[02/24/2024 11:48] la_yan
This is the basis of our protocol, it’s detailed in the docs and videos. Short answer, we infer the ibt rate from the ibt’s previewRedeem function (always on an ibt unit), and the PT rate is strictly decreasing, and decreases if and only if the ibt rate decreased

In docs, it says that after expiry the token holder could claim the remaining yield of the YT with the reference to `claimYield()`, but in the section of the docs dedicated to `claimYield` it is stated that it can only be called `before` expiry. Am I missing something?

@Yanis | Spectra The ptRate, ibtRate & yt are not completely clear to me. 

If Alice deposits 100 aUSDC (yield 5 apr), Spectra splits this into the principal token (worth 100 USDC) and the yield token (worth 5 USDC). But the amount minted of PT and YT is 1 : 1. Correct?

All the prt/ibt calculations revolve around the current price of ptUSDC/aUSDC while the yield (at least in %) is not affected. Correct?  Or is it the total value (105) that is affected?

When the value of ibtRate decreases, ptRate is decreased. 
When the value of ibtRate increases, ptRate is not changed, but the positive value is calculated as (new - old ) *yt. So with a very volatile IBT, it is reasonable to assume that ptRate can become very small but the yield calculations will also increase greatly. Correct?


[02/24/2024 13:30] la_yan
I believe something which seems unclear on your side is the difference between pt value in our protocol (given by the pt rate), the yield generated by those pts which are attributed to the YT holders AND the market prices at which PTs and YTs are traded (which can be very different). 

What you mention in the second part of your message is correct though 👌🏽 

Hope it helps

{Reactions}

[02/24/2024 13:48] sweetjimmy_
I guess there are two ways to get PT/YT tokens in spectra:

Depositing an IBT/Underlying token and getting **both**
Using the *Fixed Rates* tool and getting **just** the PT tokens
Using the *Trade Yield* tool and purchasing **just** the YT tokens

Am I right?


[02/24/2024 14:14] la_yan
That is correct, basically you can either deposit in the protocol or buy the tokens on the market based on your needs / potentiel arbitrage opportunities

[02/24/2024 17:30] la_yan
it is the same as in the erc4626 standard: the redeem method lets the user decide precisely how much shares to redeem to receive a certain amount of assets, whereas in the withdraw the user decides how much assets to withdraw redeeming a certain amount of shares. I hope it’s clear

[02/24/2024 17:59] la_yan
YT does not "generate yield" per se, 1 YT allows to keep track who should receive the yield generated by 1 PT.  Now to calculate how much yield a user should be entitled to we indeed use rates (keeping track of rate changes). I will let you dig deeper on this looking directly on the code, reading the docs or watching the videos that @Juan | Spectra shared earlier today! Hope it helps 😉


[02/24/2024 18:35] sweetjimmy_
by "redeeming shares" do you mean burning the token that represents shares? or does the user get to keep those tokens representing shares?


[02/24/2024 18:38] la_yan
Yes precisely, sorry for the misleading use of words.
Before expiry, redeems/withdraws have to burn both tokens. After expiry, only burning PTs matters, while YTs can remain unburnt (does not matter)

[02/24/2024 18:43] sweetjimmy_

[02/24/2024 18:45] la_yan
sorry i feel like maybe i was unclear ill try to rephrase my thoughts a bit better


[02/24/2024 18:51] la_yan
When depositing (let’s say using ibts for simplicity) you transfer the ibts to our contract in exchange for the worth of your deposit in PTs and YTs. Let’s say then some yield gets generated. When withdrawing you specify you want a portion (or all) of the assets amount your shares(PTs and YTs) are worth, burning the equivalent amount of those PTs and YTs of course. When redeeming the user decides the exact amount of shares he owns to be burnt, and doing so the user receives the equivalent assets amount. 

Note that in this example we consider fees to be 0, amounts minted/burnt have been vaguely mentioned (for more precision please look at the code directly), and also by simply depositing and then withdrawing, the user does not really leverages the application that Spectra offers. In other words the user could have simply kept ibts. Hope it s clearer?

Precisely! To be accurate, claiming yield in itself is nothing new since in general it’s contained directly in the IBT, but this yield tokenization design allows for the other applications that you can find in the docs;) trading future yield, fixed rates are good examples of what you can do with Spectra, but much more strategies exist

which test suite setup parameters (PrincipalTokenX.t.sol or another) would you suggest is the closest to a "complete" or realistic production deployment? E.g. some of them don't set a rewards proxy, some of them give slightly different roles to different addresses, etc.


[02/24/2024 23:21] la_yan

Basically yes, and the return values are different as well:)


[02/25/2024 09:52] la_yan
The only relevant "price" for us is the IBT price in underlying (that we call ibtRate), which we basically get by calling the previewRedeem of the 4626 IBT on an IBT_UNIT at any user interaction with our protocol. In the PT, we do not care about other external prices. Moreover, the rateOracle contract is not in the scope of this audit and should be useful for other of our products in the future, or might not even ever be relevant to us.
Hope it answers your doubts


[02/25/2024 09:54] la_yan
yeah Infura since Alchemy seems to have gone exclusively for Sepolia now. Worst case, remove the tests where you need the RPC_URL and focus on the other ones.

hi, may i confirm if the "non malicious IBT" known issue item also means that issues that (partially) rely on a faulty/vulnerable IBT implementation are out of scope? E.g should we assume that the IBT is properly protected against inflation attacks and the like. Since the IBTs themselves are mocks and thus OOS for this competition.

Spectra is permissionless in terms of ERC4626 integration. That being said, we realize it opens doors to malicious IBTs being integrated (or even non malicious but non strictly 4626). However, you should consider this to be out of scope since it will be up to users to check where they put their funds and make sure that the IBTs are safe. We of course plan on monitoring integrated vaults but we will be very upfront about that;)

Hey guys, is there is a doc of some sort to explain the rate calculation formulas in details


[02/26/2024 04:59] pkqs90
A question i have reading the yield computation is for the only postive yield is - why is the yield calculated like `newYieldInIBTRay = ibtOfPTInRay.mulDiv(_ibtRate - _oldIBTRate, _ibtRate);`, dividing the new _ibtRate instead of the old one


[02/26/2024 05:21] pkqs90
oh wait, just figured this out. anyways, still wondering if there is a doc for the mathematic formulas


[02/26/2024 08:52] sweetjimmy_
is it just me or does anyone else also think that EIP-5095 is awfully similar to EIP-4626?


[02/26/2024 09:15] jean_ch_btc
The protocol requires the `ibtRate` to have a baseline reference for comparing the price per share and accounting for the yield. It was decided to use the `previewRedeem` of one IBT unit. The protocol accepts IBT deposits and holds IBTs. Then, by considering the yield from different users and their shares, the protocol assumes linearity to convert underlying amounts (within the protocol) to IBT amounts.

- Thus, dividing an underlying amount by the `ibtRate` is an internal conversion from the underlying to IBTs. Multiplying an IBT amount by the `ibtRate`, conversely, converts IBT to underlying.
- The ptRate allows conversion between PT shares and underlying.

Thus for this specific computation, the `ibtRate` indicates the amount of underlying redeemable when burning one share of IBT. Therefore, the `ibtRate` unit is in the underlying. When the amount is subtracted between the old and new rate, we obtain the underlying difference. Dividing this underlying amount by the new `ibtRate` is a conversion from underlying to IBT, as the yield is stored in IBT (`newYieldInIBTRate`).

If there were a white paper or a sort of reference for those math calculations on yield computation that would be awesome and save a lot of time trying to figure out why certain formula is applied in certain situation


[02/26/2024 09:20] sweetjimmy_
from the readme.md 👇

"*Holding the YT allows the user to claim the corresponding amount of yield generated by the IBTs deposited in the associated PT contract.*"

So, if a user has deposited ONLY the underlying token (like USDC) that doesn't generate any yield like an IBT (like aUSDC) then that user would not be able to get any yield by calling the `claimYield` function?

@Juan | Spectra


[02/26/2024 09:22] jean_ch_btc
When a user decide to deposit in underlying the protocol will deposit these underlyings (e.g. USDC) in the IBT for him as a first step (to get aUSDC and deposit those in the PT). These are more for conveniance if you already have IBTs (aUSDC) the protocol don't expect the user to withdraw to redeposit and for the underlying one, you can do both in the same transaction.

The other DeFi protocol has an IBT 4626 representing an investment strategy, which anyone can interact with directly, for instance by depositing assets to mint IBTs. 
So of course you can always pass by the other protocol's UI to obtain your IBTs and then come on our platform and deposit your IBTs, but we propose alternatively to directly pass through us to "zap" those 2 interactions in 1 to simplify things for users. Does that make sense?

Before expiry you need to burn both your PTs/YTs to get back your investment whereas after expiry YTs become useless so we do not bother burning them anymore. Reminder that YTs are used as "tickets" that track who should receive the yield generated by the PT during the defined period.


[02/27/2024 16:35] guy_in0xnito
Ya so in redeem and withdraw function
There is said about burning the shares 
But i think in redeem says PT after expiry  but in same line it alao says PT /YT before expiry

And for withdraw function it says PT/YT Before expiry


[02/27/2024 17:41] la_yan
Both functions (withdraw and redeem) burn PT/YT before expiry and only PT after expiry


[02/27/2024 19:32] yotov721
YT becomes 0 after expiry automatically due to the logic in `YT.balanceOf()` . That is the reason it is not burned after expiery, correct ?

After expiry the yield will always be zero, not because the use of `YT.balanceOf()`(you can see on `_computeYield` they are using `actualBalanceOf` instead of `balanceOf`) but because the `ptRate` and `ibtRate` never changes after expiry in which `_computeYield` will always return the current user yield which will always be zero when user claims his yield after expiry: https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-spectra/blob/383202d0b84985122fe1ba53cfbbb68f18ba3986/src/libraries/PrincipalTokenUtil.sol#L64-L66

`ibtRate` goes up or down depending on the market. They call `previewRedeem` on the ERC4626 vault to know how much does one unit of ibt worth in terms of underlying asset: https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-spectra/blob/383202d0b84985122fe1ba53cfbbb68f18ba3986/src/tokens/PrincipalToken.sol#L902C17-L902C31
So the ERC4626 vault acts here like an oracle.
And depending on the update of `ibtRate` the `ptRate` changes: if `ibtRate` goes up, the `ptRate` stays the same. If the `ibtRate` goes down, the `ptRate` goes down (`ptRate` never increases)

In the PT contract there is only one important deadline which we refer to as expiry or maturity. The contract's function differ based on if they are called before or after that timestamp. The reason for the existence of that deadline intuitively (simplifying there) is that when investing you kind of plan on investing a certain period of time, during which your investment is lock to generate yield (until you decide to stop, in which case no yield is generated anymore). Also, try thinking about future yield trading, would it make sense to have a market for extremely big period of times? The longest the period of yield you are trading, the harder it is to make bets on the real return the investment strategy is going to make. Now what about trading an infinite future yield? It does not really make sense both for the yield traders and the PT holder.
I hope this clarifies things for you!

Q1. Here in the deposit function can anyone tell where this check condition is applied?

where can I find "RewardsProxy" contract source code? Is it another proxy like "AMTransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol"?
I ask this question because it is crucial to PT security


[02/28/2024 05:11] parthmandale
Q2. What if  what if somones oldIBTRateUser is 0, maybe because of  deposits for the first time or rates decreased to 0. Then how that return updatedUserYieldInIBT is going to get updated for them? will it be then 0?

what exactly is not clear?


[02/28/2024 05:38] blutorque
I think it happens when updateYield is called 2nd time for the user, considering the rates(_ibtRate) also changed for IBT vault.


[02/28/2024 05:52] parthmandale
Yeah I understood that, but what for 1st timer?


[02/28/2024 05:52] parthmandale
Edited the Q, now you might understand

there is no _computeYield when ibtRateOfUser is 0 that's intentional unless you have specific case in your scenario.

Hey  👋 There is no specific implementation for the rewards proxy contract. It is acknowledged that such a `delegatecall` is highly sensitive and can override storage in the PT contract instance. What I can give are general specifications that this rewards proxy will follow. The proxy contract will be stateless, with the `claimRewards` function operating independently, not interacting with the principal token's functions or state. The proxy contract will not transfer any IBT token owned by the PT. The `claimRewards` function will claim rewards from the reward program and send them to a rewardCollector, which then redirects these rewards to the Spectra governance rewards system. Each rewards proxy contract will be deployed and verified by the DAO for complying with these specifications.

_computeYield suggests that there is a case in which ptRate goes down but ibtRate goes up or stays the same. How is this possible?

if the IBT rate goes down and user interact with us then the ptRate decrease. However, the ptRate will indeed never increase again by design. Not sure what else to tell you about that

@Yanis | Spectra One of the invariants says PT rate should not increase and another one says Accounted IBT rate cannot decrease without impacting PT rate, my question is that when the PT rate decrease due to Accounted IBT rate, can it increase back to the original PT rate.

@dimulski I believe that if the vaults are vulnerable to a particular issue, the protocol should aim to protect from those vaults. Because the protocol is fully dependent on ERC-4626.


[03/02/2024 03:33] johnsmith1623
So you think uniswap should also protect from bugged ERC20s? I don't think so. We are dependent on ERC4626 compliant contracts, if they have bugs, it is their problem. Everyone should focus on their own protocol and not try to fix others issues.

{Reactions}
🙏🏽 

[03/02/2024 03:39] 0xabhay.
@JohnSmith for example USDT has 6 decimals, there may be rounding issues, mismatch slippage issues, and problems like blacklisted addresses. Shouldn't the protocol protect against these? And if there's a hack, shouldn't users be informed that this was a problem with USDT, not my protocol?

You can still be compliant to ERC4626 and create issues in the system. Could even be a non-malicious version of the vault and be invalidated by the known issues.

@Yanis | Spectra how many developers worked on writing the smart contracts? I just want to get a rough idea about the manpower it needs to build a smart contracts protocol with this quality


[03/04/2024 17:07] la_yan
Hello there 🙂 
To provide our vision on the latest topic in this group chat: if a vault is compliant to ERC4626 and yet creates an issue in our protocol then this is obviously considered as an issue to us. However, what we were saying is that our permissionless design requires users to make their own research before depositing funds in an investment strategy. Many integrated IBTs might be malicious (e.g. strait up adding a drawn_funds method), and as much as we'll try to monitor integrated vaults, it will be considered users fault to deposit in them. That being said, this detail will be very clearly displayed on our design, and popular vaults will probably be checked by many 🙂 Hope this clarifies the debate


[03/04/2024 17:15] la_yan
~10 developers worked on / tested / reviewed these smart contracts. However, the vast majority of the codebase has been written by 3 of us. It took us quite a long time though. 

Once again, we are extremely grateful for all the feedback and we thank you all for your help! 🙏

We need to wait a month to see those 2 Meds?


[03/19/2024 03:53] tigerfrake
Lol.


[03/19/2024 03:55] tigerfrake
Checked UI, not yet updated.


[03/19/2024 04:06] brivan
Did not mean that, reports usually take a month to be released


[03/19/2024 04:08] tigerfrake
Oh right. I'm sure it's gonna be out eventually. Say, Apr


[03/20/2024 18:54] 33audits
Hey man sent you a fr 🙂


[03/21/2024 22:53] vikqaz
My finding was definitely invalidated, but where can I see the judge comments or something, this was my first submission. How can I see the reason why it was not validated?


[03/21/2024 23:37] 0xhelium
Impossible


[03/21/2024 23:38] 0xhelium
You need to wait for the report


[03/22/2024 09:21] vikqaz
alright so once report is published, then everyone will be able to see all the issues including invalidated ones?


[03/22/2024 11:46] tigerfrake
I'm sure judges are always thorough in their work so chances of your "valid" findings being invalidated unjustly is almost zero. Ain't saying it can't happen, but when it comes to vulnerabilities in this space, you can never peg your life on their validity.

Do more, participate in other contests whilst waiting.
